# ExcelMediaManager
Excel Media Manager is built using Microsoft Excel and allows media files (e.g., mp3, mp4 etc.) stored in PC or network 
folders, to be scanned, indexed and organised by 'Author' (books) / 'Composer' (music) / 'Producer' (video) and the media 
'Title', using information stored in the file properties.

In addition, Excel Media Manager can be used to move or copy existing media files to a new location.

Excel Media Manager is distributed in the hope that it will be useful for assisting with organising media libraries.

Important: All files and data are the responsibility of the user(s) and must be checked thoroughly by the user(s), before
deleting, copying, moving or renaming existing files or folders. It is strongly recommended that backups are taken before 
any file or data changes are applied.
